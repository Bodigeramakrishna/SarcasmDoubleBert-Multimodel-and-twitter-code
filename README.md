# Project Statement
Sarcasm detection is a critical challenge in natural language processing (NLP) due to its dependence on contextual, emotional, and cultural nuances. Detecting sarcasm accurately is essential for improving the understanding of human communication, especially in online interactions. This paper aims to propose an effective model for sarcasm detection with the Double BERT approach, addressing the challenges of capturing contextual, demographic diversity, cultural variance and emotional patterns from text. Existing sarcasm detection models often struggle with handling diverse linguistic features and contextual variations, leading to suboptimal performance across different datasets and domains.We developed a robust sarcasm detection model using Double BERT, trained on a mixed dataset consisting of 149,480 samples
# Method Overview

We implemented a Double BERT model for sarcasm detection by concatenating two BERT models:  
- First model for text embedding  
- Second model for classification  

**Implementation Steps**:  
1. Tokenize mixed dataset text into 768-dimensional vectors  
2. Generate position-level word embeddings (dimension: 30522 × 768)  
3. Process through BERT Encoder-1 for contextual embeddings  
4. Pass outputs to classification BERT for feature refinement  
5. Concatenate outputs from both BERT components  
6. Apply dropout layer to prevent overfitting  
7. Generate class probabilities via linear layer

# Leveraging Transformers for Robust Sarcasm Detection and Contextual Understanding

## Abstract
Automatic sarcasm detection is a challenging NLP task requiring extraction of contextual, emotional, and cultural features. We propose a Double BERT model trained on 149,480 samples from diverse corpora (adversarial responses, demographic/cultural variance, emotional expressions). Our approach achieves **91% validation accuracy** and **0.912 weighted F1-score**, demonstrating optimal performance across linguistic contexts.

**Keywords**: Sarcasm detection, contextual understanding, NLP, BERT, adversarial study

## 1 Introduction
Social media growth necessitates automated text analysis tools. While sentiment analysis has advanced, sarcasm detection remains challenging due to:
- Context dependency (Shaheen & Nigam, 2022)
- Linguistic cues and cultural knowledge requirements
- Reversal of stated sentiments  

*Example*:  
> "Oh great, another meeting! That's exactly what I needed to make my day perfect."  
Positive words express negative sentiment - confusing traditional models.

### Contributions
1. Implemented Double BERT combining contextual embedding and classification
2. Trained/tested on mixed datasets across demographic/cultural contexts
3. Evaluated robustness via adversarial examples
4. Achieved **91.4% accuracy** and **91.2 weighted F1-score**

## 3 Methodology

*Figure 1: Double BERT architecture*

### 3.1 Text Embedding with BERT
**Process**:
1. WordPiece tokenization
2. Triple embedding:
   - **Word Embeddings**: 30522×768 dimensions
   - **Position Embeddings**: 512×768 dimensions
   - **Token Embeddings**: 2×768 dimensions

**Equations**:  
$$E_{(p,2i)} = \sin\left(\frac{p}{10000^{2i}}\right) \quad (1)$$
$$E_{(p,2i+1)} = \cos\left(\frac{p}{10000^{2i+1}}\right) \quad (2)$$
$$E[i] = E_w[i] + E_p[i] + E_t[i] \quad (3)$$

### 3.2 Classification BERT
Processes contextual embeddings using:
- Self-attention mechanism
- Feed-forward network
- Layer normalization

**Output**: $H_c$ (classification features)

### 3.3 Concatenation
$$H_{final} = H_l + H_c \quad (12)$$
$$H_{dropout} = \text{drop}(H_{final}) \quad (13)$$
$$Z = W_c \cdot H_{dropout} + b_c \quad (14)$$
$$P(y=i|x) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^c e^{z_j}} \quad (15)$$
