# Project Statement
Sarcasm detection is a critical challenge in natural language processing (NLP) due to its dependence on contextual, emotional, and cultural nuances. Detecting sarcasm accurately is essential for improving the understanding of human communication, especially in online interactions. This paper aims to propose an effective model for sarcasm detection with the Double BERT approach, addressing the challenges of capturing contextual, demographic diversity, cultural variance and emotional patterns from text. Existing sarcasm detection models often struggle with handling diverse linguistic features and contextual variations, leading to suboptimal performance across different datasets and domains.We developed a robust sarcasm detection model using Double BERT, trained on a mixed dataset consisting of 149,480 samples
# Method Overview
We implemented a Double BERT model for sarcasm detection by concatenating two BERT models, first model for text embedding and another for classification. First the mixed data set text data is tokenized into 768 dimensions, and it is passed to position level word embedding with dimension 30522*768. And contextual embeddings using the BERT encoder-1. The classification BERT processes these embeddings to refine features for classification. The outputs of both BERT components are concatenated, which is then passed through a dropout layer to mitigate overfitting. Finally, a linear layer generates logits for class probabilities, for accurate sarcasm detection.
**Text Embedding with BERT**:The initial phase of our methodology involves text embedding using the BERT model. This component aims to convert raw text into rich, contextualized representations that capture the semantics and relationships of words within a sentence. In this first all the input text is is tokenized into sub word units using the WordPiece tokenizer.
**Word Embeddings:**: Each token is represented as dense vector 30522*768 dimensions using a learned embedding matrix. This representation includes each word vectors on 768 dimensional spaces.
**•	Position Embeddings**: Each word positions in sentence are embedded, including words, with equations (1 and 2) and then added to each token's to provide contextual information about the token's position within the sentence at dimension 512*768.**
**•	Token Embeddings**: The inputs with multiple segments applied token based embeddings are utilized to distinguish between different segments at a dimension 2*768.
**Classification with BERT**:
The second BERT in this methodology focuses on classification based the classes like sarcasm or non sarcasm. This stage utilizes the embeddings generated in the previous step to classify the input text into different classes, such as sarcastic or non-sarcastic.
**Concatenation**:
After obtaining the outputs from both BERT components that is H_l  and H_c, the next step involves concatenation, which merges the embeddings from both models into a unified representation. The concatenation process combines the two outputs
